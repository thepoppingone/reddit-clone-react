This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to allow a **zero configuration**  setup of a React application. 
# reddit-clone-react
This is a static application that has an application state maintained by Redux-React with no data persistence. All data is reset on the loading of the page.  This application is also hosted at [Heroku.](https://reddit-clone-react.herokuapp.com)
### Components
3 components inclusive of 1 container are created for rendering the React application.
  - `App.js`
  - `Topic.js`
  - `TopicList.js` <container>
### Actions
A single action file is created for handling the 3 different actions (*upvote, downvote, create new topic)*
 - `index.js` for handling Redux Actions
### Reducers
A single reducer file is created to handle all the actions received and maintain a single application state
- `index.js` for combining reducers
- `reducer

# Testing with Jest

 The test file can be run by the following command:
 ```sh
npm test
 ```
